    <description>This workout is an introduction to strength training, yet suitable as a prenatal workout as the intervals are short, of a moderate intensity and critically at 60rpm (so not requiring you to generate too much crank torque). While this is not a Strength Endurance workout, we still stress your Type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers - but not too much!Focus on keeping your upper body still and allowing your legs to generate all the power - good form is key.</description>
