    <name>4 Intensive Anaerobic</name>
    <description>This 4th workout from the Zwift Academy program focuses on your ability to produce high power efforts above threshold, which is a significant factor in racing. This session focuses on intensive anaerobic efforts of 25sec.Because we are looking for maximal efforts in this area, full recovery is provided between each interval. Whilst the session might look simple on paper, don't be fooled. This is a high intensity session that will push you to your limits.To help you judge your effort for this duration, you will be guided through the opening intervals before being provided with the opportunity to produce your best efforts in the finale.</description>
