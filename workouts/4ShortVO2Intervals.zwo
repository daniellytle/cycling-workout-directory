    <name>4 Short VO2 Intervals</name>
    <description>Short intervals are great for adapting the anaerobic and aerobic systems as well as having a high neuromuscular component. Moreover, by specifically manipulating the work-to-rest ratios, we are able to specifically target each of these three factors to a greater extent. This session includes all the classic short intervals, from 30/30 to 30/15 to 40/20. We'll then be gradually shifting toward a more aerobic component. These sessions are great for improving your VO2 max and anaerobic capacity, and should be included early in your training season.	For WHOOP users - This workout is ideally done on a Green Recovery day. These FTP intervals will challenge you and result in a higher strain score. If you arenâ€™t well recovered, get some rest and come back to this workout on another day</description>
