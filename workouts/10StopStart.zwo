    <name>10 Stop Start</name>
    <description>This session is like walking with a 2 year old - constantly stopping and starting. You will complete 2 blocks of 5 x 45 second efforts with a good rest of 60 seconds between each effort. While your heart rate and perceived effort will surge during the 45 seconds of effort, there is ample opportunity to recover well between each effort so a suitable workout for during pregnancy or starting slowly to gain fitness.</description>
