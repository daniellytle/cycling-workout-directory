    <description>Building Endurance today! Once warmed up, ride in your ENDURANCE zone. Focus on staying relaxed on the bike and spinning circles while keeping cadence between 90-100. During the last hour of the ride complete 5 FORCE reps of 3-5 minutes each (5 minutes rest in-between) at Threshold Power. Force Reps are a big gear, low cadence effort targeting a cadence of 55-65 RPM.</description>
