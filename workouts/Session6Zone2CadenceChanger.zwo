    <name> Session6 Zone2 Cadence Changer</name>
    <description>This session,similar to the strength-endurance efforts are designed to get you used to producing the power at different cadence ranges, the higher cadences work your cardiopulmonary system much more than a lower cadence effort. You will see your heart rate rise during the high cadence element despite the power remaining the same. This session is also good at simulating bunch-riding and having to accelerate your cadence quickly without changing power too much.</description>
