    <description>In this session, we really give our Type 2 muscle fibres a huge hit, as we hit Zone 6 and complete some Anaerobic Capacity efforts!Throughout the session, we will complete 15 minutes worth of riding @ 121% of FTP - which is split up in to 3 blocks of 1 minute on, one minute off. These intervals aim to stimulate the demand of riding up short, punchy climbs - which mountain biking is renowned for! You can use whatever cadence you like for the efforts - a mix of cadences is ideal, so aim to grind a few efforts out and really rev a few to the max - 110rpm +</description>
