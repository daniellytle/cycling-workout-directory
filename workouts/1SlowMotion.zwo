    <description>This workout offers an introduction to strength endurance training, which will likely be a new type of effort for you. Riding at a low cadence really draws upon your strength, which is critical for cycling. As the blocks get shorter, the intensity increases - all at 55rpm! A challenging session - enjoy!</description>
