    <name> Long VO2max</name>
    <description>By now you should have already been through several short intervals, so now we're getting into long intervals. Typically, long intervals include anything where the reps are greater than 1 minute in duration. Compared to short intervals, the intensity typically isn't as high as short intervals — though it's still higher than FTP. In such intervals, the neuromuscular system is targeted to a lesser extent, with more focus being on anaerobic and particularly aerobic systems. For triathletes, these are the sessions you should be including in your main preparatory block before a competition. Make sure you have fresh legs and are ready to go for this one.	For WHOOP users - This workout is ideally done on a Green Recovery day. These FTP intervals will challenge you and result in a higher strain score. If you aren’t well recovered, get some rest and come back to this workout on another day.</description>
