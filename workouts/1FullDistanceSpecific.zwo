    <name>1 Full Distance Specific</name>
    <description>Looking for some brick work? You can pair today's session with run workout 3. Progressive Tempo, or run workout 2. Full-Distance Specific VO2 Max.			This session is designed to improve the aerobic threshold, which for most people is around full-distance pace. However, to make this session as specific to long-distance triathlon as possible, there are some specific 30-second bursts to induce extra fatigue before settling back into full-distance pace. Moreover, this variable intensity has been proven to be effective at pushing thresholds up. This session also allows you to become more proficient at removing lactate and using it as a fuel during the the lower intensity efforts. 	For WHOOP users — This workout is good to do on a Yellow or Green Recovery day. Due to its lower training demands, expect a lower level of strain from this session, which is ideal for days where you aren’t fully recovered.</description>
