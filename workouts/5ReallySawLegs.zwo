    <name>5 Really Saw Legs</name>
    <description>This session aims to develop your endurance by completing 3 blocks of 15 minutes around Sweet Spot, made up of short ramps to add in the constant variation in effort involved in mountain biking! There are also a few sprints thrown in there too, to simulate navigating across a technical uphill section. Additionally, the middle ramp within each block is to be completed at a low cadence, of 65rpm. Todays powers are slightly higher than last week - a sign of progression!</description>
