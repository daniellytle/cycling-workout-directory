    <description>There's no escaping the fact that VO2max intervals are hard work. However, with the right amount of VO2max work there are big gains to be made in your ability to sustain high power. VO2max is the amount of oxygen your body can use at a sustained maximal output. Simply put, the more oxygen your body can absorb the more power you will produce.In today's session we are focussing on 3min VO2max efforts. However, we are going to escalate the intensity of each interval. Starting with hard and finishing with hardest!</description>
