    <name> Week3 Crit Power Test</name>
    <description>The efforts starts with a 20 second all out sprint (the idea is to ride this 20s as hard as you can and ignore the fact that you have to continue riding for a further 2min 40sec). as you begin to fade on the sprint, you will need to gradually reduce your gearing to maintain a cadence of around 90rpm, all whilst pushing as much power as you possibly can!. this will feel like a very long 3 minutes. the key is to not bail on the effort! regardless of how much your power fades throughout the effort, you MUST finish it.</description>
