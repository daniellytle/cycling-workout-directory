    <description>Looking for some brick work? You can pair today's session with run workout 3. Progressive Tempo, or run workout 2. Full-Distance Specific VO2 Max.			This session is typically known as an up-and-under session, where you perform periods of time slightly over and then slightly under 70.3 race pace power. This is a great way to get more comfortable at your 70.3 pace, while also improving that number. Here, you will be doing 8-minute reps — two rounds of 2 minutes above (around 90% FTP) and two rounds of 2 minutes below (around 80% FTP) 70.3 race pace. From a physiological perspective, these sessions help promote fat oxidation and structural changes at a muscular level. 	For WHOOP users — This workout is good to do on a Yellow or Green Recovery day. These up-and-under intervals have great training impacts with a lower level of strain, which is ideal for days that you haven’t had decent recovery.</description>
