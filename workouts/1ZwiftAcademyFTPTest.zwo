    <name>1 Zwift Academy FTP Test</name>
    <description>Prior to commencing the Zwift Academy 2017, we ask that you complete a threshold test on your indoor trainer. This test is intended to set your training zones for the duration of the academy and aid us in our selection process for the next stages of the competition. This test is best carried out with a power meter or smart trainer, however a heart rate monitor will suffice, if you do not have access to one. The test starts with a long, progressive warm up followed by some activation work, designed to prime you for the upcoming effort. The warm-up is a vital component to this test and will enable you to perform at the optimum capacity.  On completion of the warm up, it's time for the test! Simply, go as hard as you can for 20 minutes. ERG mode will turn off for the 20 min segment. Youâ€™re on your own. Pace yourself throughout, trying not to go too hard, too soon but finish with an empty tank, all out. Ensure a good warm down after the test and put your feet up.</description>
