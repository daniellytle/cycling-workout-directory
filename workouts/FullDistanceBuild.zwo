    <name> Full Distance Build</name>
    <description>This session is designed to improve the aerobic threshold, which for most people is around full-distance pace. However, to make this session as specific to long-distance triathlon as possible, there are some specific higher intensity efforts meant to induce extra fatigue before settling back into full-distance pace. This session also aims to make you more proficient at removing lactate and using it as a fuel during lower intensity efforts, as well as improving your gross efficiency.</description>
