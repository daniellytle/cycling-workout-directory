    <description>Today's session continues to focus on developing your endurance and aerobic conditioning which are fundamental attributes for anyone looking to perform.  We are going to push ourselves right up to our threshold, by completing 6 efforts, split in to two blocks of 3 efforts (90%, 95% and 100% of our FTP). As the intensity goes up, the volume goes down so this session is definitely manageable and is a nice building block rather than leaving you totally exhausted for tomorrow.</description>
