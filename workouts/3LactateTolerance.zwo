    <name>3 Lactate Tolerance</name>
    <description>When you need to constantly perform small surges of power—and keep pushing hard between these surges like in a Time Trial or when in fast paceline in a group ride—you're going to need excellent lactate tolerance. The better you are at metabolizing lactate, the better your endurance.     This session has two goals: enhance lactate tolerance, which allows you to perform at intensities above your FTP for longer, and boost your VO2 Max. This session will hold you at a high VO2 max over the majority of each set and raise your maximal aerobic capacity.        Coach's Tip: Zwift Academy Road was developed with structure in mind.
