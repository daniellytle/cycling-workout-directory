    <name> Week1 Zwift Zone3 Leg Work</name>
    <description>Let's build some leg strength! These high torque efforts at a sustainable power will increase your ability to generate force in races. After a 10 minutes warm-up in Zone 1-2, begin with the first effort - 10 minutes at Z3 with a low cadence (65-75rpm). Ride 5 min recovery and then repeat 2 more times. 3 x 10 min efforts. Tips: Remain seated through efforts. Don't go all out! This is a controlled effort. It should be comfortably hard, but hardly comfortable!</description>
