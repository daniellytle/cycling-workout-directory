    <name>2 Microbursts30s</name>
    <description>Microbursts are great to do on a regular basis to make sure that you can change speeds anytime no matter the activity you are doing as well as handle power fluctuations on the bike. Each set consists of 10x 30 seconds on (120-130% of FTP) and :15 seconds off (40-50% of FTP). These will definitely be entertaining for the mind yet very challenging for everyone. The great thing about this workout is you will see improvement from the first time doing this to the 2nd and beyond.</description>
