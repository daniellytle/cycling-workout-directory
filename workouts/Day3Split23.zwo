    <description>This session is best done indoors on the trainer (A split session, Zone 2 followed by Zone 3). Watch the rpm's change to activate different energy systems and work the legs and lungs.  A cardio workout followed by a leg workout. No recovery between the efforts, so straight into the Zone 3 block from the 30 mins @ zone 2</description>
